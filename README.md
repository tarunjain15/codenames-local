The script will:
- Automatically stop any existing server on port 3000

## AI-Powered Word Generation

With an Anthropic API key, the game:
- Generates fresh, theme-appropriate words for each game
- Ensures words work well for Codenames (multiple associations)
- Prevents repetition across recent games
- Falls back to predefined words if AI is unavailable

The system automatically adds Codenames-specific requirements to all themes, ensuring generated words have multiple meanings and enable creative clue-giving.

## Custom Themes

### Via Web Interface
Navigate to `http://192.168.1.46:3000/add-theme` to create custom themes with:
- Theme name and description
- AI prompt for word generation
- Optional base words as fallback

### Theme Creation Tips
- Focus on words with multiple associations
- Include mix of concrete and abstract concepts
- Ensure words are familiar to your target audience
- Avoid overly similar words in the same theme

## Architecture

- **Domain-First Design**: Core game logic separated from infrastructure
- **Two-View System**: Public board view + private spymaster views
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket-based state updates
- **No Database**: In-memory state for local play
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack

## Development

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Game Rules Modifications

- **Teams**: Pink and Orange (instead of Red and Blue)
- **Scoring**: Shows remaining cards to find (not cards found)
- **Turns**: Players manage turns themselves (no strict enforcement)
- **Confirmation**: Click confirmation prevents accidental reveals
- **New Game**: Easy new game creation without server restart
